# Project Description

Accordion Demo with jQuery, Sass and CSS3 Transitions

## Project Details

- Build a jQuery Accordion WITHOUT using slideUp, slideDown, or slideToggle. Hint: use addClass & removeClass.

- Only CSS3 transitions allowed. It should work for 2 or more sections.

- Each paragraph in each section of the accordion should be a different length. It's important to learn how to deal with variable content length.
